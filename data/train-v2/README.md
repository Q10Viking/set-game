The _train-v2_ dataset is a collection of Set card images.

The _raw_ directory contains original camera images. Each image is a 
photo of a board of 27 images, arranged in a 3 by 9 grid. There are three
boards, one contains all the Set cards with one shape, one with two shapes,
and one with three shapes.

The _raw_ images are photos of the same boards taken at different times under
varying lighting conditions, from different angles, and with different cameras.
